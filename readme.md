## Instructions

To complete the tests in this lab, you will need to overwrite some styles depending on the width of the screen. If you're unclear about any of the instructions below, remember that you can check the test file to see what exactly is being tested.

### 768px to 1279px

- [ ] Hide the `.splash` section by changing the `display` property to `none`.
- [ ] Set the width of the `main` element to be `90%`.
- [ ] Update the `footer` element so that instead of three columns it is set to have two.
